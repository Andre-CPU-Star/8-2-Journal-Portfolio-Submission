SNHU/CS-230/8-2 Journal: Portfolio Submission


Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The gaming room client wanted us to code an application that was based on a agme where users woudl see imigaes and then guess to solve a puzzle. They wanted us to make the game web based so more peopel would be able to access is. They wanted su to explain the benefits and downsides to each OS and then make recomendatiosn based on those for which would woudl be the best for both the company and then end user.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
What i feel that I did well on is the development requirments prtion which I went into pretty good detail in to explain what each OS brigns to the table, and 
this detail helps to back up my recommendation in the later protion of the document. Each section had lots of detail and was broekn down into mutiple catagories 
exmapling the pros and cons of each OS, taking into account who the end user was which is a company so its important to keep in mind the cost things the product 
which I did mutiple times for each OS when in came to the cost for the IDE as well for the developer who will program in each specfic language.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
WHat i thought was helpful from the design document was it helped me to better understand what the overall idea behidn the project was, this also gave me 
time to understand what the user wanted from me and to then make those proper changes to the code. It overall helped me to understand what was being asked 
which guided me in the right direction of making the chnages to the code 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could make a chnage to my final project document I would have made changes to the reconmenndation section by adding more detail, I think I did a good 
job adding detail but I know there was so much more information whcih could have been added and went into detail about. An example fo this would have been 
the secuity part where I explained all of the built in security of windows but I could have went mroe in depth and talked about the built in secuity measures 
in the code whcih could have helped the reader better understand why my recommendatiosn was windows and then built on that. I could have also went in more 
detail of all the built in features of windows which is vast, but due to time constraints and not wanted to add to much information i kep[t it to the basics.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I tried my best to understand the users needs in the project ebcause that is what we are the building the application for is the user, there would be no 
point in creatring something if the end user is unhappy, This is why it sos important to consider the users needs ebcause it helps to guide me and other 
developers code to best suit the needs to the end user which in turn will keep them happy and more product beign developed.


How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I think the biggist thign that I woudl take away from this is one to fully understand what is being asked before trying to impliment stuff that is confusing 
whcih can cause errors and delays and in the end possibly have an unhappy end user whcih is hwo we are trying to keep happy in the first palce. Secodnly, is 
to be detasiled orineted and doubel check all of your work escecially in the coding process as we all know a upcase letter could result in bad code which adds 
to time and money from both the developer and the end user which is never the goal.
